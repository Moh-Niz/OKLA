# Okla

# DESCRIPTION
Okla is a Quiz App designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The app is a 3-paged site and it allows users to answer questions based on their knowledge of the March 2023 UCD software Engineering Cohort. There are 2 categories - questions about the students and tutor, four questions each. A total score of 40 can be attained and an email validation form was implemented. The app features a timer that can not be restarted with a refresh or user leaving the page. This is my second submission in the course. HTML was used to define the structure of Okla, CSS was used to style while Javascript was used to add interactivity.
